              <p class="post-content">Before continuing to read the rest of this manifesto, please pause. Look around to every corner of your house, inside every drawer, and especially into the storage room. Look at each item carefully, and try to answer the following questions: </p>
              <ul class="post-content">
                <li>When did you buy the item?</li>
                <li>Why did you buy that item in the first place?</li>
                <li>When did the last time you used that item?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="post-content">For most of the items, my guess is that you don't even remember of having them, let alone remembering when you bought them, or why.</p>
              <p class="post-content">In the era of cheap goods from China and online shopping, it is become easier for us to buy things that we don’t need. The reasons for most of the time are one or more of the followings: it was sold at a discount, just in case we need it someday, special price when bought in bulk, helping a friend, shopping therapy. We probably look at the item once or twice, probably use it once or twice, and then it goes into the drawer, storage, or sometime even to our bag, without we even noticing.</p>
              <p class="post-content">Believe it or not, this kind of behavior of hoarding stuff is also linked to the state of our mind. Studies showed that those who are hoarding and cluttering are likely to have unfocused mind, often under high amount of stress.</p>
              <p class="post-content">Obviously, the reverse will also work. If you feel stressed, lack of control, and have unfocused mind, simplifying your life will help to improve that. Decluttering will help you to start simplifying your life. The same studies showed that decluttering your home is the first step towards decluttering your mind, and reduce stress. Decluttering your home is a start to building a habit to declutter your mind, and eventually your life.</p>
              <p class="post-content">So, while you are looking at your drawer, and storage room, and answer the questions above, lets start to take action to declutter your life:</p>
              <ul class="post-content">
                <li>Do I really need that item today, or in near future (1 week to 1 month)?</li>
                <li>If the answer is no, is there anyone who possibly need it, and can make use of the item better? If the answer is yes, then donate it.</li>
                <li>If the answer is no, then it is time to dispose the item. Don’t box and categorize it. Dispose it. No buts, no ifs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="post-content">Finally, the next time before you clicked the buy button, or check out at the cashier, ask the following question to yourself: Do I really need the item, or do I buy it because of other reasons?</p>
